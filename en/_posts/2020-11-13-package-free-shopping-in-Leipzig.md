A package free shop is a perfect place to start your zero waste journey. But where to find one?! Let me tell you actually, four amazing package free shops are waiting for you to be discovered in Leipzig. Two in the West, one in the East and one in Südvorstadt! 

Hey hey!

Zero waste/unpackaged/package free shops are magical places, where you can refill your own containers (ice cream tubs, jars, bread bags or whatever you have) and buy as much or as little of things as you want! They usually offer loose dry ingredients (flours, pastas, rices, lentils, baking ingredients and much more), liquid refills (oil, ketchup, soy sauce, vinegar), cleaning products (washing up liquid, laundry detergent), personal care products (shampoo, conditioner, soap) and fresh locally sourced, seasonal fruits and vegetables.

I believe we are really lucky in Leipzig as there are 4 (four!) amazing dedicated package free shops.

### Einfach Unverpackt

[Einfach Unverpackt](https://www.einfach-unverpackt.de/) has two shops; one in Südvorstadt in Kochstraße that opened back in 2016 and the newer one which opened last year in Schleußig in Könneritzstraße. You can follow them on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/EinfachUnverpackt/) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/einfachunverpackt/).

### Locker und Lose
[Locker und Lose](https://locker-lose.de/) is located in Reudnitz in Josaphinestraße just next to the Lene-Voigt-Park. You can follow them on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/lockerloseleipzig/) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/lockerloseleipzig/).

### lieber lose
[Lieberlose](https://www.lieberlose.de/) opened in 2019 in Weißenfelser Straße in Plagwitz. You can follow them on [Facebook](facebook.com/lieberlose) and [Instagram](www.instagram.com/lieberlose).

I personally believe that all the four shops sell a full range of products, so I suggest that you check out ALL of them! Visit them regularly and give them your support!

Please let me know if you know about any other shops in Leipzig!
