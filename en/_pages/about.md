### What is Zero Waste Living in Leipzig?

Zero Waste Living in Leipzig is a bilingual (EN/DE) community group for sharing local tips how to live a sustainable life and aiming for zero waste.
The idea is the strengthen the Zero Waste community in Leipzig by supporting each other on our journey to zero waste.

Zero Waste Living in Leipzig started as a Meetup group in June 2020 when I (Celia) moved to Leipzig.
[Here](https://www.meetup.com/Zero-Waste-Leipzig/) you can join our Meetup group and see the upcoming events.
There is also a [closed Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/280043056684330) where we can to talk to each other online and share tips and infos.

However, I found that information should be available also outside of social media so I created this website where I will try to collect all the practical information I gathered since I moved to Leipzig.

### Why is it in only English?

When I arrived to Leipzig (actually even before) I was looking for information on sustainable low waste living in Leipzig, possible in English as I am not a native speaker.
After arriving and meeting people, I realised that actually there are many English speaking Expats in Leipzig who would like to live a more sustainable life but lacking the right information. And trust me, it is not like we do not want to integrate, most of us working hard to learn German and trying to find ourselves in the new city.
The aim is to have this website bilingual and I am working on the technical parts!
