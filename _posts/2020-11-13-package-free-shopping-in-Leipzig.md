Hey hey!

I believe we are really lucky in Leipzig as we have 4 (four!) amazing dedicated package free shops.

[Einfach Unverpackt](https://www.einfach-unverpackt.de/) has two shops; one in Südvorstadt in Kochstraße that opened back in 2016 and the newer one which opened last year in Schleußig in Könneritzstraße.

[Locker und Lose](https://locker-lose.de/) is located in Reudnitz in Josaphinestraße.

[Lieberlose](https://www.lieberlose.de/) opened in 2019 in Weißenfelser Straße in Reudnitz.
